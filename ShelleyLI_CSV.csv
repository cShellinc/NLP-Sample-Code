Application for Acceptance to MMAI Program
Queen’s Smith School of Business
Please find enclosed my resume for consideration for acceptance to the Queen’s Smith School of Business 
MMAI program.  I am a woman that has spent my entire career working in technology.  I received my Honors 
Bachelor of Commerce from Laurentian University in the 90’s when I was told that “business and computers 
didn’t go together” academically.  My passion for computer programming drove me to take a second 
undergraduate degree in Computer Science part time in the evenings following my Commerce degree while 
working full time in the IT department of a leasing company.
"I have filled various roles in IT over my career including desktop support; development (mainframe Unix, C, "
"C++, Java, VB, etc); Business Analysis; Architecture; Project and Program Management; Consulting and was "
even interim CIO and divisional CIO for Direct Energy.
I have been working as an independent consultant for the last 5+ years and have a proven track record of 
leading successful turnaround and transformation change in complex and geographically diverse organizations 
both operationally and on a project basis. My strong commitment to risk-based decision making and clarity in 
communication have been cornerstones of my success.
"Having earned a reputation as a transformation delivery expert with organizations and vendors alike, I feel I "
am the perfect candidate to take a program such as this.  With my expertise in large scale technology 
integrations and transformation coupled with my Artificial Intelligence education through MIT’s executive 
"education programs, I know that I can be successful in this program.  "
My personal brand signifies excellence in leadership and technology delivery services and I continually strive 
to deliver to this high standard. 
I am an active mentor to many high potential individuals and provide industry guidance as a regular speaker 
"for CIO Executive Council, Women in Leadership and Accelerated Development programs.  I have "
consistently been a part of high-performance teams that deliver to high standards of quality.  
"I know I would be a valuable addition to the MMAI program, and I look forward to further discussing how the "
addition of my background could add diversity and new perspectives to the next cohort.  I would very much like 
to find out about any grant opportunities that may be available to someone like me and explore with you 
potential funding arrangements.
